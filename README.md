Feather
=======

Feather is a minimalist administration plugin for MineCraft servers.

### Features

 - fine-grained permission control
 - vote-based community system

#### Commands Added

 - **/vote kick &lt;player&gt;** — initiate a new vote to kick the target player.
 - **/vote &lt;yes|no&gt; [player]** — agree or disagree with a vote. If there is more than one active vote, specify the player as well.
 - **/info &lt;player&gt;** — display stats about a player.
 - **/like &lt;player&gt;** — commend a player for their thoughtful actions!
 - **/dislike &lt;player&gt;** — call out a player for doing something you didn't like.

And all this, with:

 - zero runtime dependencies (i.e. doesn't require Bukkit)
 - no need to update whenever Minecraft is updated (see [Architecture](#architecture))
 - a super-simple installation procedure that doesn't involve editing any JARs
